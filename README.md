# Challenge-1-Horiseon

For this challenge I worked on the Horiseon Webpage. 

The webpage already had code written in it so I needed to scan through the code for extra code created and fix the UI in the webpage to make it more presentable.

I scanned the code and found extra code written that made the CSS code longer than it needed to be. So I trimmed down the code by commbining some of the classes
that had similar styles. I also added a few classes to target certain code to make the webpage more presentable. I added more to the webpage to hopefully make 
the company satisfied with my choice of styles. 

Screenshots of improved code I made:
